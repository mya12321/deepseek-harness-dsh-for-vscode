# DeepSeek Harness(dsh) for VS Code

[English](README.md) · [简体中文](README.zh-CN.md)

**A Cursor-like AI coding experience inside VS Code — powered by your own DeepSeek Harness (DSH) agent.**

Embeds the full DSH web UI in the VS Code auxiliary sidebar: every window automatically starts and owns a local `dsh web` service (cwd = current workspace), so your modules, skills, MCP servers, credentials and sessions all just work. On top of that it adds the IDE integration layer:

- **Chat in the sidebar**: `Ctrl+Alt+B` opens it; copy/paste/context menu, file jumps and theme following are all native
- **Context attachment**: right-click a file / selection / folder / Problems to append a compact link to the DSH draft — source text is never pasted, nothing is ever auto-sent
- **DSH Changes review**: workspace edits pushed by DSH land in a dedicated tree with diff / accept / undo; every write needs explicit approval (on by default)
- **@dsh chat participant**: type `@dsh` in the native VS Code chat to talk to your local DSH session with streaming replies — zero Copilot quota (on by default)
- **Advanced, opt-in**: Ctrl+K / Ctrl+I inline edit, model routing into the VS Code LM picker, MCP consumption, terminal / UI bridges, FIM tab completion — every capability behind an explicit consent switch

## ⚠️ Compatibility

| Item | Requirement |
|---|---|
| VS Code | ≥ 1.106, desktop only; remote / virtual / untrusted workspaces not supported |
| DSH CLI | `npm i -g @deepseek-ai/dsh`, requires ≥ 0.1.3-alpha.2 (typert wire protocol; tested on 0.1.5) |
| Node.js | auto-detected; set `dsh.local.nodePath` for non-standard locations |

> **Wire protocol:** since dsh 0.1.3-alpha.2 the runtime speaks the typert gateway — slashed JSON-RPC endpoints (`POST /api/session/list`, `/api/session/prompt`, …) and WebSocket event streams on `/api/remote.mux`. This extension hardcodes that protocol and no longer uses the legacy `session.list` / `session.export` / `events.mux` / `workspace.list` endpoints (no fallback), so dsh builds below 0.1.3-alpha.2 cannot work with it.

## 📦 Install

- **Marketplace (recommended)**: search **DeepSeek Harness** (publisher Xizhi1024) in the Extensions view, or `code --install-extension Xizhi1024.dsh-vs-sidebar`
- **VSIX**: download from [Releases](https://github.com/Xizhi1024/deepseek-harness-dsh-for-vscode/releases) → `Extensions: Install from VSIX...`

## 🚀 Usage

1. Press `Ctrl+Alt+B` — the extension starts (or reuses) the local `dsh web` and loads the UI
2. Select code → right-click **Add to DSH Thread**; the draft receives a compact `file:line` link, press Enter to send
3. Type `@dsh` + your question in the VS Code chat — replies stream from your local DSH session
4. Let DSH propose an edit through the bridge: it lands in the **DSH Changes** view for diff / accept / undo — nothing is written without approval

Common commands (palette, `DSH:` prefix): New / Switch Session · Open Session History · Restart / Stop Server · Open in Browser · New DSH Instance (Ctrl+Alt+N) · Diagnose · Restart Cleanly · Set DSH FIM API Key.

## ⚙️ Configuration

| Key | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `dsh.port` | 3080 | Port for the DSH web server |
| `dsh.autoStart` | true | Start the service when VS Code opens |
| `dsh.home.mode` | shared | shared = official ~/.dsh; isolated = extension-private home |
| `dsh.profile` | web | DSH profile directory name |
| `dsh.executablePath` | (empty) | Explicit DSH executable / package dir / shim; takes precedence over discovery |
| `dsh.closePolicy` | onVscodeExit | When to stop the owned server |
| `dsh.features.changes-review` | true | DSH changes review (approval-gated writes) |
| `dsh.changes.observe-tools` | true | Attribute tool-made edits in the changes tree (tool group) |
| `dsh.features.chat-participant` | true | @dsh chat participant |
| `dsh.features.ctrl-k` / `ctrl-i` | false | Inline edit commands (Ctrl+K / Ctrl+I) |
| `dsh.features.lm-route` | false | Expose DSH models in the VS Code LM picker |
| `dsh.features.mcp-consume` | false | Let DSH consume VS Code-side MCP servers |
| `dsh.features.tab-completion` | false | FIM tab completion — needs `dsh.fim.baseUrl` + **DSH: Set FIM API Key**, then restart the DSH server |
| `dsh.fim.baseUrl` | (empty) | Upstream FIM endpoint (full URL of an OpenAI-compatible completions API) |
| `dsh.keybindings.ctrlL` | true | Ctrl+L adds the selection to the thread (never sends) |
| `dsh.bridge.terminal` / `editorRead` / `ui` | false | Terminal / editor-read / UI surface bridges (consent switches) |

Full key list in `package.json`; run **DSH: Diagnose** for a health summary.

## 🪟 Window & environment sharing (`dsh.share.mode`)

**`environment` (default)** — all VS Code windows of one OS environment converge on **one** DSH instance:

- The **first** window starts it (owned, per the close policy); every other window **adopts** it as a reused instance and never stops it.
- The instance keeps running while at least one attached window is open. When the spawning window exits, it is left running for the remaining windows; the activation sweep reclaims it only after the owner **and** every attached window are gone.
- **Windows vs WSL stay separate**: a Remote-WSL window runs the extension inside WSL, so it finds (or starts) the WSL instance; Windows windows use the Windows instance. A WSL window that has not explicitly set `dsh.port` uses its own default port **3081**, so WSL2 localhost forwarding can never make one environment adopt the other's instance. An explicit `dsh.port` is always honored verbatim.
- Switching folders inside a window (multi-root) rebinds the running instance through the DSH workspace registry — the child is never killed.

**`window` (legacy)** — every VS Code window probes the configured port, treats any occupant as somebody else's, and spawns its own child on a scanned-forward free port.

In both modes `dsh.autoStart = false` keeps the strict user-managed semantics: probe the configured port, reuse, never spawn, never stop.
